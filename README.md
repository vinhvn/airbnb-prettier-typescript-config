# airbnb-prettier-typescript-config

A reusable dotfiles config for a new project to properly set up [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) with [airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [React](https://reactjs.org/) rules for new projects.

This was created mainly for my own use but feel free to clone and use my setup! ðŸ˜„
